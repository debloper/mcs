# Mozilla Community Sites
Welcome to the Mozilla Community Sites (MCS) code repo. There's not much here at the moment, since we're working in the `wordpress` branch.
## Want to get involved?
Come join us in irc://irc.mozilla.org/#mcs or join our [mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-local-sites).

## Collaboration is good.
